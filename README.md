# Fingerprint-Matching
This project takes in an image of a finger, then preprocesses this input image to extract the fingerprint and using SIFT, checks if this fingerprint is already present in the database. And make sure to capture the image of finger with sufficient constrast and details for better results.
The codes are to be run in the following order:
1) remove_back.py
2) preprocess.py
3) sift_detect.py (in the output folder)
